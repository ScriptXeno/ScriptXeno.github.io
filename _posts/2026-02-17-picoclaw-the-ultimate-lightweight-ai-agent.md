# Introduction: What is PicoClaw?

PicoClaw is an ultra-lightweight AI assistant written entirely in Go, designed to run on extremely low-cost hardware while consuming less than 10MB of RAM. It represents a new category of minimal AI agents optimized for performance, portability, and efficiency.

Unlike traditional AI assistants that require powerful servers or cloud-heavy infrastructure, PicoClaw operates on devices as affordable as $10 Linux boards. With a boot time of under one second and a single self-contained binary, it is redefining what “edge AI” truly means.

Inspired by nanobot-style AI agents but fully re-engineered in Go, PicoClaw demonstrates how modern AI automation can be both resource-efficient and highly capable.
